       "'1. Boil a large pot of water and add a generous amount of salt.\\n2. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook according to the package instructions, usually around 8-12 minutes for dried pasta or 2-4 minutes for fresh pasta.\\n3. While the pasta is cooking, prepare the sauce. For a classic Italian pasta dish, you can make a simple tomato sauce by saut√©ing garlic and onions in olive oil, then adding canned tomatoes, salt, pepper, and any desired herbs such as basil or oregano.\\n4. Once the pasta is al dente (firm to the bite), drain it and add it to the sauce. Toss to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce.\\n5. Serve the pasta in individual bowls and garnish with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.\\n6. Enjoy your delicious Italian pasta!'"
